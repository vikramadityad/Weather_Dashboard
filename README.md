- Display current weather conditions including city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- Show a 5-day forecast with date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
- Maintain a search history of cities for quick access to weather information.
- Click on a city in the search history to view current and future conditions for that city.
